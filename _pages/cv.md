Work experience
======
* <ins>2024-Present: Integrator and system administrator at Neptucom:</ins> I’m working with different systems and their REST APIs to make creative solutions that are improving the productivity and the efficiency of the company, while, designing said solutions to be easily maintainable, versatile and general purpose as possible. I’m using MAKE.com platform to develop and maintain automations and solutions that integrate between multiple platform, and developing software that uses data from various of Neptucom’s vendors; and works coupled to the CRM and other platforms that Neptucom uses. I’m also the designer and maintainer of Neptucom’s CRM and come up with upgrades that can improve our teams’ effectiveness and quality of life. A few examples of my work are: I Designed and implemented an AI based chat-bot for Neptucom’s customer support WhatsApp, for this project I developed a full-fledged API that enables the AI agent to interact with various of Neptucom’s services; This API is designed to be dockerized via docker composed, and is deployed on AWS. A full scale project that map, organize and manage the clients’ statuses, and sync the findings to various of Neptucom’s platforms. Designed dashboards that uses CRM’s data to display multiple statistical views and findings. Developed a solution that takes raw streams of data and analyze to show various statistical findings. Most of my work is independent; which means that I’m planning, designing and implementing the solutions by myself (and might come up with the feature concept itself). Furthermore, I help deciding and designing the overall structure and workflow of the technological solutions that we use, and which solution to use in the first place.
