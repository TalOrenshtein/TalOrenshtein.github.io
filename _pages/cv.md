Work experience
======

* <ins>2024-Present: Integrator and system administrator at Neptucom:</ins> I’m working with different systems and their REST APIs to develop creative solutions that are improving the productivity and the efficiency of the company, while, designing said solutions to be easily maintainable, versatile and general purpose as possible. I develop and maintain automations and solutions that integrate between multiple platform, and develop software that uses data from various of Neptucom’s vendors; and works coupled to other platforms that Neptucom uses like their CRM. I’m the designer and maintainer of Neptucom’s CRM and come up with upgrades that can improve our teams’ effectiveness and quality of life. A few examples of my work are: I designed and implemented an AI agent for Neptucom’s customer support WhatsApp, for this project I developed a full-fledged API that enables the AI agent to interact with various of Neptucom’s services; This API uses cutting edge technologies like docker composed, FastAPI, traefik, redis and more, and is deployed on AWS. I designed a billing and discounts&coupons systems to manage the customers’ recurring payment and one-time-charges based on many factors like the order’s phone lines’ statuses, and which discounts that were given while purchasing are currently eligible. I developed a platform that help coworkers track their and their team’s projects and tasks while allowing collaborations, and allowing management’s supervision. Most of my work is independent; which means that I’m designing and implementing the solutions by myself (and might come up with the feature concept itself). Furthermore, I help deciding and designing the overall structure and workflow of the technological solutions that we use, and which solution to use in the first place.
