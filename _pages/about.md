Hi, and welcome to my little corner :)

I'm Tal (Yosef)  Orenshtein and I'm a B.Sc. Computer Science graduate from the Open University. I excel at back-end development, with a passion about infosec. I'm a Linux user and I'm in my free time I'm learning various concepts, programming languages, SoC and more.
