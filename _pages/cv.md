Education
======
* 2017-2023: B.Sc. in Computer Science at The Open University, graduating soon (Average score:
81).
* 2016: Bagrut at Computer Science: My friend and I studied together to extend our Bagrut certificate
on our free time, while we served at the army.

Practical knowledge
======
Algorithms, data structures, multithreading, defensive programming ,networking, database systems.

Programming languages
======
* Java: I made various software using Java, learned it while both doing my Bargut certificate and as
part of my academic studies. Specifically, I took 2 courses that was about Java, Introduction (grade:
90) and Advanced (grade:87). One of the projects I made while taking the advanced course, that
uses various programming concepts like advanced multi-threading and networking concepts, is
presented in my portfolio.
* PostgreSQL: One of the academic courses I chose to take was about PostgreSQL (grade 89). I
learned to use complex, nested queries to extract data as needed.
* C++, Python and SQLite3: I learned C++ and Python while taking a course about defensive
programming (grade:87) as part of my academic studies, I self taught both while using online
resources, books and the official docs. As part of the course, I made a server-client project, I used
C++ at the client side and Python and SQLite3 at the server side, while, learning SQLite3 on the fly
while taking advantage of my PostgreSQL skills I already had. This project, that uses various
concepts including defensive programming and networking concepts, is presented in my portfolio.

Work experience
======
* 2017-2018: Worked at IBM at the Lenovo department as a technical support: We dealt with a large
customer base; I diagnosed problems with both my existing knowledge and researching on the fly.
Then, depending on the problem, I fixed it by giving instructions or using remote control tools. Also, I
made followup calls to costumers as needed, usually when the fix included steps that the costumer
needed to follow, when either a step took some time to perform, or the consumer ask to continue the
procedure at a more convenient time for them.
* 2016-2022 (During my degree): I taught Java to high school and college students: Usually I had to start
from the very basic starting point: types, conditions and loops, then continue with Object Oriented
Programming principles, both the basics and more advanced topics like Polymorphism, and ended up
with teaching recursion and efficiency in both principles and practice. Sometimes I also taught generics
concepts, depends on the studentâ€™s needs.
* 2013-2014- PC Technician: I fixed hardware and software problems, Install OSs and drivers, solved
issues both on site and via remote control.
  
Israel Defense Forces (2014-2017)
